Manage easily, who is allowed to access your blog or certain parts of your blog or just improve the security of your installation

== Description ==

Private! makes it possible to build private blogs for your friends, family or your business.

**But Private! can do much more for you!**

= Common Features =
The configuration is as simple as powerful and the best of all: It's incredible fast - you will not
notice any differences from your standard installation to running a fully protected blog. It does
not modify your roles, capabilities and it does not need new tables or adds queries to your normal pages.

= Content Restrictions =
You can use Private! to protect paid content on your page. Lock down your blog and decide who can
access your front page, blog page, content pages, category archive, tag archive, search, feeds and
so on. You can allow full access to your blog and restrict the access to posts in single or multiple
categories and/or tags. You can allow access to certain posts even, if they are in protected
categories or tags. You can give your users access to restricted areas for years or seconds. It's
up to you!

= Security =
Improve the security of your blog by customizing your login failure messages, prevent brute force, XSS,
SQL, Field Truncation, Session Hijacking and more attacks, slow down attackers, force your users to
use strong passwords or just add or remove RSD/WLW/Generator Tags from your blog and/or the blogs
readme.html. And this is the only plugin, that can improve the security network wide. You can
force every blogs in you network to use your preferred settings by default.

= Multisite Enhancements =
Users can now register directly on single blogs in multisite installations. Network admins can force
users to stay related to the main blog. Both options must be approved in the private.php. Remember
the plugin must be installed in the main blog too or you have to activate the plugin as network plugin.

= Translations =
English, german and brazilian portugese translations are included. This is my first wordpress plugin.
Please tell me about bugs and errors or send me translations.

** This plugin requires PHP 5.1 or newer **

== Installation ==

1. Upload `private` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure who should be allowed to access your blog or parts of your blogs
4. Decide for every user, how long a user should be able to see restricted areas (optional)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I cannot access my blog? =
Please read the descriptions. This plugin is very restrictive. If you just click enable, you will not 
be able to access your blog. But the good news is, the plugin will not lock you out, click on personal 
settings and give yourself an authorization timestamp in the future and you are back in business.

= Is it compatible to cache plugins? =
It should be. Tell your caching script, that it should not cache logged in users (that should be the default) 
and clear the cache after configuration. Regular pages for guests should be cached. Restricted areas should 
not be cached, as the user must be logged in.

= Why does Plugins like "Ultimate Security Check" keep telling me, my blog is still hackable with malicious URL requests? =
Because the test is somehow stupid. It's not enough to send a single "eval" or "base64" command without any 
parameters to your blog to hack it, but exactly this is simulated. You will have to send special url requests, 
that match more criterias than that. If you just deny access to urls, that have "eval", "base64" or "select union" 
in it, you will run into big problems e. g. you are a SQL Expert or Developer and want to write about these functions.
